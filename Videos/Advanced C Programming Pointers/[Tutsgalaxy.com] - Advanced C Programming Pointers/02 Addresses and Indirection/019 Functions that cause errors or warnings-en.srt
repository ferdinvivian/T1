1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,050
Now if I compile this code in Microsoft Visual Studio I have a problem.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,130
I'm told that by default see the error message.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:22,450
SDR and CPI is considered to be a deprecated function and I should use the safer SDR in C.P. why underscore

4
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,260
Yes.

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,540
Now it is quite possible that your C compiler will complain about some functions either this one or

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,930
maybe some of those functions that I use in my code but which your compiler warns you are old that pre-created

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,250
or unsafe.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,620
So why am I using them.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,890
Simple answer is to make sure that my code will run in pretty much any C compiler.

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,630
Often I use the simplest most traditional functions for clarity and to ensure compatibility.

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:57,520
But it is true that in many cases there may be better and safer alternative functions which you may

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,030
prefer to use in your own programs.

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,440
If for example your compiler or your ID tells you that the function is unsafe you may want to stop to

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,370
look up the documentation of the recommended function and use that instead.

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,070
Or you can define the constant suggested so you can see here it suggests to disable the application.

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,900
Use this constant down here so I could copy that into my source code.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,970
I've already made a copy ready to go and put it up here.

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:43,350
Saved my program and should tell the compiler to stop pestering me with error messages about the function

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,870
in question so see if that works.

20
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,260
Try rebuilding it goes a little think about it.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,640
And yes so this time it seems to be quite happy.

22
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,130
Compile the program on there are no errors

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,500
so although there on your end say for functions that C compilers and platforms may use.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,830
The danger is that they are going to be specific to those compilers.

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:19,030
The SDR and CPI underscore as function for example is provided by Microsoft but it may not work with

26
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,380
other compilers.

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:30,850
So bear in mind that my code in this course sticks whenever possible to older traditional while widely

28
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,620
supported functions purely for compatibility.

29
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:43,960
Even though your C system may have newer and safer alternatives and you can look those up in the documentation

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,960
and use them if they are recommended.
