00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,760
Up to now we've looked at pointers to data of some sort.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,120
But you could also have pointers to functions.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,980
Function pointers are typically used when handling asynchronous events events that can happen at unpredictable

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,460
moments and which have to be able to trigger a function call to handle them.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:30,810
For example you may want to call a certain function when an event fires to signal that the final document

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,060
in a printer queue has been printed.

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,080
Or you may want to call a function on a specific mouse event occurs.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,070
Say when a menu item is clicked in your application function pointers.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:50,950
While they may seem a bit obscure and it is quite possible that you may never need to use them but in

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,980
special cases they are useful and it's certainly worth knowing about them in the next couple of lessons.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll explain how to declare and use function pointers in C.
