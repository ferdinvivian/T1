00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:10,510
Incidentally in this simple program no attempt has been made ever to free any of the allocated memory.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,010
You often don't need to do that in programs where memory it's allocated and remains in use.

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:25,320
But is it remains referenced by pointers throughout the entire lifetime of the program.

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,570
And when you close the program allocated memory will be automatically freed up.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,200
At least it will on a desktop operating system.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,480
Even so we do need to know how to free memory from list items explicitly.

7
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,630
And I look at that in a later to lessen.
