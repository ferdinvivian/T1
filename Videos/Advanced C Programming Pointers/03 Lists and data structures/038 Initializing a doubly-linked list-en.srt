Initializing a doubly linked list is a bit trickier than initializing a singly linked list.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,280
Remember when I create a singly linked list I just keep adding a new struct at the front of the existing

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,640
list

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:25,150
and that makes it easy to initialize a pointer to point to the struct that was added previously but

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:34,040
with a doubly linked list I need pointers to point in both directions both the previous element in the

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:42,340
list and to the next element and that poses an interesting problem since of course when I add a struct

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,510
I can set its pointer to the struct on one side of it.

8
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:57,250
I like that that is to the previously added struct but I can't set a pointer to the struct.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
On the other side that is the next element in the list.

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,530
Because I haven't tested it yet.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,450
Now let's look at my code to see how I can deal with that problem.
