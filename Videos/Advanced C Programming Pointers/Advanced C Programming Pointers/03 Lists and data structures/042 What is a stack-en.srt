1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:08,670
A stock is another very important type of data structure whereas a Q is a first in first out structure

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,890
where the first thing that's handed to the queue is also the first thing that's taken off the queue.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,220
A stock is a last in first out structure.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,500
The last thing that is the thing you most recently added to the stack is the first thing that's taken

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,860
off it.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,100
So if I treat a pile of playing cards as a cue I'd build it up by adding cards one by one like this

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,990
ace of spades 9 of clubs Jack of Diamonds six of spades Queen of Hearts.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,050
And when I want to take cards from the cue I take off the one I did first.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,590
Well that was the ace of spades.

10
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,090
And then the next one on so on.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,630
But if this was implemented as a stock I wouldn't do that.

12
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,730
A stock is last in first out last card I did was the Queen of Hearts.

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,030
So that's the first one I take off.

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,620
Then the one I added before that.

15
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:21,500
And so on down through my stock another way of thinking this is like a stack of plates you build up

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,610
the stock by adding more plates on top of it.

17
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:41,190
And when it's time for dinner you take the last plate you are the first then the next one and so on.

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,880
So think of a cue as a bit like a line of people waiting to go to the cinema.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,270
First come first served the first to join the queue is also the first to leave the queue.

20
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,190
But this stock is like a stack of plates.

21
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,960
The last to be added to the stack the plate right at the top is the first to leave it.

22
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,640
It's the first plate I take off the top of the stack when I'm ready for my dinner.
