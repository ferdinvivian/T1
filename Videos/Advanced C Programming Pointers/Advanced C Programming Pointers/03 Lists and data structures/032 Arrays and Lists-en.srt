Up to now whenever I want to to create a list of data items I've used an array arrays are very convenient

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,680
as they are fairly easy to use and they make it easy to get a specific element by putting an index number

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,290
between square brackets.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,390
In many cases a simple array.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,410
Maybe all you need whenever you want to create a new list of items but arrays have some disadvantages.

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,350
The most obvious of these is the array has a fixed length.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,070
If I declare an array for five elements I can't add a sixth on the end of it.

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,430
Once an array is being created its size is fixed.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,850
A workaround would be to create an array much bigger than I think I'll ever need.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,350
So I might declare an array capable of storing a hundred elements but only initialize it with 20.

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,090
But it gives me the option of adding another 80 elements if I happen to need them.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,540
But this is obviously inefficient.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,870
And in any case my initial estimate might be wrong.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,330
I might need to add 81 new elements in which case I have a problem again.

15
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,370
One way around this problem is to create a linked list instead of an array.

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,120
So what's the difference between a linked list and an array.

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,780
Well let's find out next.
