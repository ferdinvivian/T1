00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:09,490
Another common problem occurs when you try to use memory that's already been freed here for example

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,890
I allocate 100 bytes for my child pointer B.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,590
I then assign B to C and then later on I free the.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,010
And then I decided to use my char pointer.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,430
See I copy the string Hello into the memory to which it points.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,700
But that's a mistake because that memory is no longer allocated.

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,420
I fried it when I called free with the B pointer.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,120
So what happens when I run my code once again that's unpredictable.

9
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,740
It may cause different problems with different compilers and it might also depend on what else you've

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,070
done in your program that might have some other side effect.

11
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:02,780
All I can say for sure is that trying to use memory that's being freed is not at all a good thing to

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:02,990
do.

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,350
Let's let's try this out let's try first to see what Visual Studio does.

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,290
OK well this is what it does.

15
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,420
It keeps on printing.

16
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,750
C is c.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,120
Time after time after time.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
Now I've no idea why it does that.

19
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,290
Frankly your guess is as good as mine.

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,690
Well let's see what happens in code light.

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:37,710
So here I am using code like with a new C compiler GCC and Romanes Well at first sight looks fine.

22
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,240
Ah but now I can see there is a problem.

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,930
So in those two compilers I get two different problems.

24
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:58,650
Clearly neither is good so the problem that was hidden in my code.

25
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:08,520
The reuse of memory that is freed causes unpredictable errors depending on which compiler I am using.

26
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,740
Either way this is not a good thing.
