1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,360
So that's it.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:11,160
You've now arrived at the end of the course we covered so many different topics punter's dresses array's

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:20,760
indirection allocating and freeing memory data type alignment pointer arithmetic linguists stucks cues

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,300
function pointers deep and shallow copying.

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,680
Well lots more besides.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,690
Even though pointers are really quite simple things they can be used in all sorts of very complicated

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,790
ways.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,250
And as I've shown in this last few lessons even simple mistakes on using pointers can result in really

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,880
serious program errors.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,400
So where to next in this course.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,160
I certainly haven't covered everything you can do with pointers.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,910
Per example.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,510
There are all sorts of complex data structures that you could create with pointers branching trees for

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:08,550
instance instead of linear lists under numerous searching out rhythms that can be used to find data

15
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,600
items in structures linked to using pointers point.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,560
The point of this point of course is not to cover all the things that pointers can be used for.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,290
That would make a very very long course indeed.

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,470
In any case there are lots of books and online tutorials about data structures in file handling searching

19
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,770
and sorting out rhythms and so on.

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,430
All of which you may use pointers.

21
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,710
The aim of this course is to explain exactly how pointers work.

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:53,460
So having completed the course you should now be able to use pointers safely in your own programs and

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,940
understand how to allocate and free memory or how to create data structures and ensure the pointers

24
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:07,500
that link together the elements of those structures always refer to point to the correct things.

25
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:16,290
In short you should have a pretty good understanding of what pointers are and how they work and you

26
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,290
should be able to use them correctly.

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,860
And that is one of the most important skills any C programmer can have.

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,040
A deep understanding of pointers really separates a good programmer a professional programmer from an

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:45,100
average programmer hobbyist or an amateur know that you have that skill you can use pointers properly.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,450
It may of course take some time and coding practice until you've really absorbed all this information

31
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,030
and then it becomes second nature to you.

32
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,580
To do that take your time to watch videos on any topics you find especially difficult.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,050
And be sure to use the source code supplied with this course.

34
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,950
The best next steps to take to deepen your knowledge is to modify some of my own code examples.

35
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,450
Try rewriting.

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,620
I dunno maybe to remove not just one but a whole range of elements from a list or.

37
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:25,430
Or to create stocks that grow downwards instead of upwards and then pick your own programming subject.

38
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,380
Something that interests you.

39
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:37,720
Disk Utility or a simple database game whatever you find interesting and use pointers in them.

40
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,700
Now there's no getting away from the fact that using pointers and using them well is difficult.

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,060
But now you've completed this course you've already gone far further to gain a really solid understanding

42
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,880
of pointers than the vast majority of programmers.

43
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,860
So finally all that remains is for me to thank you for putting in the time and the effort to study this

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,390
course and believe me I do know how much effort this takes.

45
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,770
Let me end by giving you my best wishes for your future programming career with pantos.

46
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,840
Lots and lots of pointers point to.
